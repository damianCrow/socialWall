Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

How to get composer and npm if ypu don,t have them?

You can use FTP or SCP command to upload composer.phar to the host after downloading it locally. Or use wget and curl to get the file directly on host,

$ wget https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar

or

$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php — –filename=composer

The best way to install npm is to install node using <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fnodejs.org%2F&amp;t=ZmM2MTQyYTgxMjg3ZDM1ZGU5MDI1YWQ0Yjc5OGU1MTU5MWIxMjYyMSxENW01czlHRg%3D%3D">the node.js installer</a>. npm is installed as part of node.
